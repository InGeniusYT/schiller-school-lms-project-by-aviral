# Warm greetings sir.

## This project is about the LMS project made by me (Aviral Maitrey - Class 5) for the school.

# I have used a library namely django in this project.

# So for making this project your very own, follow the given instructions:

## Go to this [link](http://git-scm.com/) and install git. (How to install git tutorials are available on the net.)

## Open up Commmand Prompt and write git clone https://github.com/InGeniusYT/schiller-school-lms-project-by-aviral.

## Then write this command : cd schiller-school-lms-project-by-aviral

## Then write this command : pip install virtualenvwrapper-win

## Then write this command : mkvirtualenv lmsApp. after doing this you will see lmsApp in the brackets before the file location which will we C:\Users\UserID.

## Then write this command : pip install django

## Then write this command : python manage.py migrate.

## And at the end write this command : python manage.py runserver.



# And the app has been made.

*You will get and URL like : 127.0.0.1:8000/

## Simply go to that url whatever you will get.
